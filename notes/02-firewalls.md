# 02 â€“ Firewalls

## Overview
Firewalls control traffic between networks. They enforce security policies by allowing or blocking traffic based on rules.

## Types
- **Packet Filtering**: Filters packets based on IP, port, protocol.
- **Stateful Inspection**: Tracks state of active connections.
- **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)**: Deep packet inspection, application awareness.

## Best Practices
- Deny by default.
- Use layered firewall architecture.
- Regularly update rules and firmware.
